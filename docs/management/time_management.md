# 25 Time management hacks

1. Work less, have more fun
2. Only plan for 4-5 hours of _real_ work per day. Days _always_ fil up
3. It's normal to have days where you just can't work and days where you'll work 12 hours straight. Work more when you're _in the zone_. _Relax_ when you're not.
4. Stop multitasking. It merely kills your focus.
5. Set up a work routine and stick with it. Your body will adapt.
6. We're always more _focused_ and _productive_ with limited time.
7. Work is the best way to get working. Start with short tasks to get the ball rolling
8. _Doing_ is better than _perfect_. Work iteratively. Expectations to do things perfectly are stifling.
9. More work hours _doesn't_ mean more productivity. Use constraints tas opportunities.
10. Seperate thinking and execution to execute faster and think better. Seperate _brainless_ and _strategic_ tasks to become motre productive.
11. Organize meetings early during the day. Time leading up to an event is often wasted.
12. Group meetings and communication (email or phone) to create blocks of uninterrupted work.
13. Keep the same context throughout the day. Switching between projects/clients is unproductive.
14. Work _around_ procrastination. Procrastinate _between_ intense sprints of work (Pomodoro)
15. Break the unreasonable down into reasonable chunks. A big goal is only achieved when every little thing that you do everyday, gets you closer to that goal.
16. No 2 tasks ever hold the same importance. Always prioritize. Be realy careful with to-do lists....
17. Only work on the thing that will have the biggest impact. Always know the _one_ thing you really need to get done during the day.
18. Break tasks into hour increments. Long tasks are hard to get into; feels like it needs to get done.
19. If something can be done 80% as well by someone else, delegate. Delegate and learn how to make use of other people.
20. Turn the page on yesterday. Only ever think about today and tomorrow.
21. Set deadlines for everything. Don't led tasks go on indefinitely.
22. Set end dates for intense or stressful activities. Everythign ends at some point.
23. "Get a remidner app for everything. Do not trust your brain for your memory". _Always_ take notes.
24. Write down anything that distracts you - Google searches, random thoughts, new ideas, whatever. The point is, if you write them down, they'll stop bubbling up when you're in the zone.
25. Take breaks. _Sometimes_.
